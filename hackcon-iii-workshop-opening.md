# Hackcon III Workshop

* University of Maryland received 30 MILLION DOLLARS in 1 single donation.
* Your results can be this too.
* The Hacker Survey (100+ question survey) during the season.
* Your event is really important because it is the one that will tell them whether or not they like hackathons.
* They go to your event to learn, network, building, fun, novelty, friends, experience, etc.
* People don't go to hackathons for swag.
* NEEDS:
  * Fast Internet
  * Travel Reimbursement (NOT REALLY)
  * and many more.
* Hackers don't care about the size of the hackathon.
* Attendees want an event between 100-600 people.
