* Not Outreach, Sponsorship, Marketing
* It's everything. - Everything not related to money or marketing.
* Organizing a hackathon is not easy. It will make you have sleepness nights.
* There are first steps. MLH is a dang good step. MLH empowers you to put on your hackathon.
* Establish a timeline.

### 4-9 Months Out

* Get a Venue. Lock it down.
* There are multiple types of hack rooms.
* Large rooms are a good idea, but can be difficult to setup.
* Smaller Rooms are good. You risk cutting apart your groups.
* WiFi - Talk to your IT Department. You should expect your hackers to show up with fat least 4 devices. You need to be ready. If the wifi doesn't work they'll be pissed.
* Power is in the same boat, 2.5 outlets per hacker.
* AV - Project + Auditorium
* Tables - Good.
* Cost of the venue - majority do not pay for their venues. If you can cut the venue cost, try it.
* Go to administration at school and point to the other schools and challenge them to keep up with other schools. This is a competition. Startup incubators are usually a good idea too.

### 4 Months Out  
* Have a team
* Establish your brand - why are you doing a hackathon. You have to have a reason. Sharing tech. Amazing sponsors to the area / campus. Create a culture around hacking. Make it part of your brand. Bitcamp does a great job at branding.
* Grab social media handles before!
* Made fun of other hackathons.
* Start working on sponsorship. It's really really hard.
* Don't put it on a credit card. Ever.
* Reach out to MLH.

### 2 Months Out
* Start your promotion. You should have a marketing engine. Marketing takes a lot of work. Keep the buzz and the spirit of your event alive. "50 Days of Bitcamp"
* Line up prizes - Cash prizes are a bad idea at a collegiate hackathon. In the back of your mind, you've already spent that money. You'll be let down and disappointed if you lose. Provide prizes that continue the spirit of hacking alive. 3D Printed Mascots are way cool.
* Find Mentors, Judges, and Volunteers. Be upfront with judges. Do NOT allow them to ask the question "How do you make money?" - Combat that early. Find Volunteers early. Source your friends. Look at service organizations. Give them enough information to solidfy their schedule.
* Source your Workshops. - These can be your sponsors, but make sure to look to the community. Workshop pros - they can be great and need to give them a heads up to prepare. Cons are you can let down those putting it on. If you wouldn't attend it, it shouldn't happen. Be careful about
* Launch Registration. - Establish a headcount. Email them. Keep them excited. Name, School, Major, T-Shirt, Food, Gender, Race, demographic analytics are important.

### 1 Month Out
* Establish your headcount.
* Hackathon Attrition - 1/3 => 1/2 of the participants will not show up. It makes it hard to do that. They won't make it to the final day. Those coming from outside the state, once their there, they are staying. From campus, odds are, a decent chunk of them aren't going to stay till the end. You have to deploy strategies to keep people going.
* Over Register!
* Schedule Transports. If you have a 40 person bus, get 70 people to sign up for them.
* Order your swag!
* If your swag isn't high quality, people aren't going to wear it. Get quality swag!
* Order your food. Catering vs Local Restaurants. On campus catering (you'll probably pay more and food might not be that good) but you're building a nice schedule to help.
* Breakfast is more expensive.
* Pizza, Pasta, and Subs suck. DONT DO THAT.
* Release a schedule
* Plan for an emergency. Have the information at the ready.

### 1 Week Away!
* Send Reminders. Remind Sponsors. Remind Vendors, double and triple check with your vendors. Remind your students. They have no idea where your campus is, where to park, where they might sleep, etc.
* Provide a map to vendors.
* Provide a "checklist" of things to remember to bring to your hackathon.
* Prepare your volunteers. Share why you're doing it. Spread the good word and
* Buy Snacks. - Costco / Sams Club - Pulling things off the shelves, it's awesome. Get awesome snacks. Channel the "shopping spree" and tweet that shiz. Have a mix of unhealthy and healthy
* Coordinate and setup a Run of Show. This should be detailed to the max.
* Plan to sleep.
* Make sure to plan there is someone awake at all times.
* Don't try redbull for the first time.

### Day of Hackathon
* Event Setup. Establish a place for registration. First place they will see. Registration should be good, excited, energized, and should look good.
* Welcome your sponsors, thank them for coming, be excited for them coming. Introduce them to your hackers as soon as you can. Put your sponsors with your hackers. Don't separate them! (They can be in the halls) give them access to your participants.
* Put out FOOD. People will be hungry. Have food out immediately. Snacks should be out.
* Do a check tech. All presenters should have a quick run through. Check wi-fi, have a backup wi-fi system! APs will get overloaded. Be ready to convert to wired if needed. Don't forget to check your power.

### Opening Ceremonies
* This sets the tone of the event.
* Deltahacks - back story and put in so much work.
* Do API Demos at the beginning. Be respectful of hackers time. Don't spend 2 hours on APIs!!! Quick, easy, keep the energy up.

### During Hackathon
* Run a Team Formation Workshop (MLH can help)
* Run contests
* Have mini events. Be visible. Be in front of everyone. Make yourselves useful.
* Feed hackers every 6 hours. Refill water, drinks, etc. Have Snack Access Points / Areas.
* Take a moment to stop being an organizer and walk into the middle of it and look around. Take it in and feel the shit out of it. You should be proud of it. You are awesome.
* Start sourcing hackathon submissions. Have volunteers and organizers tell hackers that projects need to be submitted.
* Judging.

### Judging
* Expo  or Presentations.
* Presentation style isn't bad over 30 submissions.
* Bring everyone up to the stage, give them 2 minutes to show off their hacks.
* Expo style - Whole bunch of tables and have judges walking around. MLH can help.
* Stack Ranking - Break judges into zones. 10-20, 20-30, etc. Assign judges to each of those zones. Repeat the process. Expo judging is something MLH is really good at.
* Respect your participants time. They want to go home. Now is not the time to have the dean of your university come and talk for 2 hours. If you do a final presentation, make sure to have them do a tech check.
* Grab Dev Evangelists and have them pre-judge your pitches. Don't pitch crappy hacks. Dev Evangelists know how to present.
* Thank EVERYONE. Volunteers, Sponsors, School, Organizers, Hackers, everyone.

### Event is Over
* Go to sleep before anything after.
* After you wake up, follow up with everyone.
* Send pictures, lists of people who hacked on sponsor apis, thank thank thank thank, take volunteers out for a dinner and a meal and cover that cost.
* Settle your books. Make sure everyone gets paid for everything. Hold all receipts and everything else.
* Start collecting success stories.
* Your hackathon was awesome and everyone needs to know that and remember it. You need to know it and remember it.
* Let's do this again. The second hacakthon is considerably easier to do. You have tangilble concrete evidence make sure to use it.
* Build a legacy on campus. Keep resources and records for people in the future.
